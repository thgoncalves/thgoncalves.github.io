title: What is Data Science!
---

Hello and Welcome. This is my very first post on my webpage and I decided to start simple, but simply trying to define "What is Data Science"

So, what is _Data Science_?
Data Science has become a buzz word in the last decade or so. We can often hear discussions about it on many discussion groups all over the place. Programs, diplomas, and certificates are being offered over many well-known institutions across the globe.

New platforms such as _Udemy_ and _Youtube_ have tons of materials on this subject. Companies are increasingly talking about the necessity of having Data Scientists on their workforce, keeping them on the ever-changing
competitive business market.

That is all nice and relevant, but what is to be a Data Scientist or to work with Date science?

Data Science is the domain that uses scientific methods to analyze and solve a specific problem. In this case, the methods used are a merge of Computer Science and Statistics applied to any kind of data source.

A Datasource is nothing more than a collection of data assembled in any possible form. A CSV (comma-separated value file), XML, JSON, Image, Audio, Video, Webpage, all of those are sources of data, and being able to connect to them and extract information is the primary function of a Data Scientist.

A Data Scientist is the professional that can dig into Datasources and extract important significance from them. We can say that the extraction of all Sales Orders of a certain company into an Excel file is your Datasource. A possible Data Scientist's responsibility would transform that raw data into, for example, a forecasting report for sales for the next year.

In other words, transform trends in the past in possibilities for the upcoming future.

Data Science has been around for quite some time now. It is not a new carer that has been recently created by some high expert group of individuals. Rather, is a discipline dominated by academics and statisticians for centuries. That's right, this is an old discipline that has been around and (unappreciated) by companies all over the place.

But I still haven't answered the main question: As the name implies, is the ability to study and process information available all around us. To be a Data Scientist is to be able to extract information from chaos. Useful, usable and actionable information from unclear, confusing and incomplete data sets. A Data Scientist has the tools and experience to make that transformation (from data to information).

So, why has Data Science become a buzz word lately? My answer to that has 2 parts. The first is due to the incredible technological progress over the past few years. Computers are more powerful (both servers and personal computers). GPUs are foster, internet speeds are faster. You can easily analyze an immense number of rows of data just by opening them on a simple spreadsheet, like excel or google sheets. Access to technology has never been easier.

Second, today we generate a lot of data by using our smartphones, credit scores, public transportation cards, internet usage and so on. Even If a person has no social media user, is almost certain they are generating data somehow (and this is a topic for another day).

The Data Scientist needs to shape himself in a way that will make him able to navigate this sea of data and be able to study and make conclusions that are critical to the business.
